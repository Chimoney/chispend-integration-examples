## Integrating ChiSpend

Integrating ChiSpend doesn't require you having any special skill. Yes, It's as easy as dropping an `iframe` in your existing web application!
For more context:

```html
 <iframe
  src="https://chispend.com/?cSContext={{YOUR PREFERRED SPEND CONTEXT}}"
  title="ChiSpend Widget"
  >
```
___Pretty easy right??? See I told youüòÅ.___

## Customizing ChiSpend:

Customizing `ChiSpend` is a walk in the park just as installing it is. Infact, you don't need to do anything other than modify the `url` a bit. Simple right? Let's get it:

```html
 <iframe
  src="https://chispend.com/?cSContext=evm&primaryColor=eb4034&xAppTheme=light"
  title="ChiSpend Widget"
  >
```

### Customization Options:

- __primaryColor__: Css hex code without the `#` to use as primaryColor for the shopping experience.

- __maxAmountInUSD__: Maximum amount in __USD__(Dollars) a user is allowed to spend in the `Embed`.
- __cSContext__: The `SpendContext`.
- __xAppStyle__: The app theme to use in the `ChiSpend` widget.

<br></br>
### <a name="get_api_key"></a>  **Get your Api Key**

To integrate your wallet for payments(`Pay With Wallet`), you need an `ApiKey`. This will be needed to send the `Chimoney Object` to the api.
To get the `Apikey` you need to [book a demo](https://chimoney.io/book-a-demo).

<br></br>
### <a name="integrate_ext_wallet"></a>  **Build the experience**

`ChiSpend` provides the `Pay with Wallet` option for the `web` SpendContext, This allows you __intercept__ the checkout process and manage the payment flow, You can attach a listener to the event posted by the `ChiSpend` widget to get an object which should be sent to the api to finish the payment flow. Before that you can carry out your business specific logic. See the example below:

```js
 const handleMessage = (e) => {
      // Don't proceed if there's no payment link.
      if (!e.data?.paymentLink) return;
      
      // Carry out business specific logic (e.g transction charge) and send Chimoney object (i.e e.data) to  ChiConnect.
      alert(`Here is the chimoney object for your transaction:\n${JSON.stringify(e.data, null, 2)}`);
    }
  
 // Listen for ChiSpend Pay with Wallet event. 
 window.addEventListener("message", handleMessage, false);
```


<br></br>
### Sample Chimoney Object for external wallet integration

```json
{
    "currency": "USD",
    "totalDueinUSD": 50.5,
    "issueID": "abcdefghijkl_50_00000000000000",
    "amount": 50,
    "ottData": {},
    "paymentLink": "https://dash.chimoney.io/pay/?issueID=abcdefghijkl_50_00000000000000",
